## Berlin 'Museums Sonntag' Ticket Finder

View live here: https://museumssonntag.deno.dev

Every first Sunday of the month, Berlin's public museums allow entry free-of-charge.
Many of these museums participate in a digital ticketing system to help manage time-slots and overall demand.
Tickets can be booked starting 7 days before every Museum Sunday.

Unfortunately, the official 'Museums Sonntag' website makes it hard to find what tickets remain.
This app lists all ticket quotas and availabilities on one page.
Now you can quickly see all remaining tickets and book whatever looks interesting to you.

I hope this tool is useful to you <3
